## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Insight Generation Algorithm

**Core Insight Formula:**
```
Strategic Insights = f(Performance Analysis, Risk Assessment, Trend Evaluation, Success Identification)

Where:
- Performance Analysis = Overall and category-specific performance evaluation
- Risk Assessment = Identification of underperforming areas and potential risks
- Trend Evaluation = Historical performance trajectory analysis
- Success Identification = Recognition of high-performing strategic areas
```

### Performance-Based Insight Generation

**Performance Threshold Analysis:**
```
Overall Performance Evaluation:
if (Overall Performance < 60%) {
    Generate: "Performance Below Target" insight
    Type: "warning"
    Priority: HIGH
    Color: Orange/Red
} else if (Overall Performance ≥ 90%) {
    Generate: "Excellent Performance" insight
    Type: "success"  
    Priority: RECOGNITION
    Color: Green
}
```

**Detailed Performance Insight Calculation:**
```
Performance Assessment Process:
1. Calculate overall strategic performance percentage
2. Compare against organizational performance thresholds
3. Determine insight type and priority level
4. Generate specific recommendations based on performance level
5. Assign appropriate visual indicators (color, icon)
```

**Example Performance Insight Generation:**
```
Current Performance: 58%
Threshold Analysis: 58% < 60% → Below acceptable performance level

Generated Insight:
{
    type: "warning",
    icon: "fa fa-exclamation-triangle",
    title: "Performance Below Target",
    description: "Overall performance is at 58%, which is below the recommended 75% threshold.",
    action: "Focus on underperforming objectives and consider resource reallocation."
}
```

### Sub-Objectives Analysis

**Sub-Objectives Completion Assessment:**
```
Sub-Objectives Completion Rate = (Completed Sub-Objectives ÷ Total Available) × 100

Insight Generation Logic:
if (Completion Rate < 50%) {
    Generate: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention" insight
    Type: "info"
    Focus: Tactical execution improvement
}
```

**Calculation Example:**
```
Sub-Objectives Analysis:
Total Available Sub-Objectives: 36 (12 objectives × 3 sub-objectives each)
Completed Sub-Objectives: 17
Completion Rate = (17 ÷ 36) × 100 = 47%

Since 47% < 50%, generate insight:
{
    type: "info",
    icon: "fa fa-tasks",
    title: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention",
    description: "Only 47% of sub-objectives are completed across all strategic areas.",
    action: "Prioritize completing sub-objectives to ensure comprehensive strategy execution."
}
```

### Category-Specific Risk Insights

**Poor Performing Categories Identification:**
```
Poor Category Criteria:
- Average Performance < 60%
- Completion Rate < 40%

Risk Insight Generation:
if (Poor Categories Count > 0) {
    Generate: "Critical Areas Identified" insight
    Type: "danger"
    Impact: HIGH
    Urgency: IMMEDIATE
}
```

**Category Risk Assessment Process:**
1. **Evaluate Each Category**:
   ```
   For each strategic category:
   Performance Score = Average of objective performances in category
   Completion Score = (Completed sub-objectives ÷ Available sub-objectives) × 100
   
   if (Performance < 60% AND Completion < 40%) {
       Flag as "Critical Risk"
   }
   ```

2. **Generate Risk Insight**:
   ```
   Critical Categories = [List of poor performing categories]
   Insight = {
       type: "danger",
       title: "Critical Areas Identified",
       description: "{Category names} require immediate attention.",
       action: "Develop action plans for these strategic areas to improve performance."
   }
   ```

**Example Risk Insight:**
```
Category Performance Analysis:
- Growth: 45% performance, 30% completion → Critical
- Customer: 52% performance, 35% completion → Critical
- Operations: 78% performance, 70% completion → Acceptable

Critical Categories: ["Growth", "Customer"]

Generated Insight:
{
    type: "danger",
    icon: "fa fa-flag",
    title: "Critical Areas Identified",
    description: "Growth, Customer require immediate attention.",
    action: "Develop action plans for these strategic areas to improve performance."
}
```

### Success Recognition Insights

**Excellence Identification Algorithm:**
```
Excellence Criteria:
- Category Performance ≥ 90%
- Completion Rate ≥ 80%

Success Insight Generation:
if (Excellent Categories Count > 0) {
    Generate: "Leading Categories" insight
    Type: "success"
    Purpose: Best practice recognition and scaling
}
```

**Success Analysis Example:**
```
Excellence Assessment:
- Innovation: 94% performance, 85% completion → Excellent
- HR: 91% performance, 82% completion → Excellent
- Operations: 78% performance, 70% completion → Good (not excellent)

Excellent Categories: ["Innovation", "HR"]

Generated Insight:
{
    type: "success",
    icon: "fa fa-star",
    title: "Leading Categories",
    description: "Innovation, HR are performing exceptionally well.",
    action: "Leverage successful strategies from these areas for other categories."
}
```
