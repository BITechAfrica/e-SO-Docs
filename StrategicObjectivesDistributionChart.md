## Description and Overview

The **Strategic Objectives Distribution Chart** provides a visual representation of how strategic objectives are allocated across different organizational categories. This pie chart visualization enables executives and stakeholders to understand the strategic focus distribution and ensure balanced attention across all critical business areas.

The chart displays:
- **Category Segments** - Visual pie slices representing each strategic category
- **Objective Counts** - Number of objectives assigned to each category
- **Proportional Sizing** - Slice sizes reflecting relative objective distribution
- **Color Coding** - Distinct colors for each strategic category for easy identification
- **Category Labels** - Clear identification of each strategic focus area

This visualization helps organizations assess whether their strategic portfolio is appropriately balanced and aligned with business priorities.

## Why is it Important

### Strategic Portfolio Management
The Distribution Chart is essential for strategic oversight because it:

1. **Balance Assessment**: Reveals whether strategic attention is appropriately distributed across business areas
2. **Resource Allocation Insight**: Shows where organizational strategic capacity is focused
3. **Priority Visualization**: Makes strategic priorities visible through objective distribution
4. **Gap Identification**: Highlights areas that may be under-represented in strategic planning
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Provides clear visual representation of strategic focus for governance

### Executive Benefits
- **Portfolio Balance**: Ensures no critical business area is neglected in strategic planning
- **Strategic Alignment**: Verifies that objective distribution matches stated organizational priorities
- **Resource Planning**: Informs staffing and budget allocation decisions across strategic areas
- **Governance Support**: Provides visual evidence of strategic focus for board and investor communications

## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Objective Distribution Calculation

**Primary Distribution Formula:**
```
Category Distribution = Count of objectives per strategic category

Distribution Series = [
    Growth Objectives Count,
    Operations Objectives Count,
    HR Objectives Count,
    Customer Objectives Count,
    Innovation Objectives Count,
    ESG Objectives Count
]
```

**Calculation Process:**
1. **Group Objectives by Category**:
   ```
   For each strategic category:
   Category Count = strategicObjectives.filter(objective => 
       objective.objectiveName === category.name).length
   ```

2. **Create Distribution Array**:
   ```
   Distribution Data = strategicCategories.map(category =>
       strategicObjectives.filter(obj => obj.objectiveName === category.name).length
   )
   ```

3. **Generate Chart Series**:
   ```
   Chart Series = Distribution Data
   Chart Labels = Category Names
   Chart Colors = Predefined category colors
   ```

### Detailed Calculation Example

**TechCorp Strategic Objectives Distribution:**

**Objective Inventory:**
```
Strategic Objectives by Category:

Growth Objectives:
1. Revenue Growth Target
2. Market Share Expansion  
3. Head Count Growth
4. Geographic Expansion
Total Growth: 4 objectives

Operations Excellence Objectives:
1. Productivity Improvement
2. Efficiency Enhancement
3. System Availability
Total Operations: 3 objectives

Human Capital Objectives:
1. Employee Engagement
2. Retention Rate
Total HR: 2 objectives

Customer Centric Objectives:
1. Customer Satisfaction
2. Net Promoter Score
3. Customer Retention
Total Customer: 3 objectives

Innovation Objectives:
1. New Product Revenue
2. R&D Investment
Total Innovation: 2 objectives

ESG Objectives:
1. Sustainable Revenue
Total ESG: 1 objective
```

**Distribution Calculation:**
```
Category Distribution:
- Growth: 4 objectives (26.7% of total)
- Operations: 3 objectives (20.0% of total)
- Human Capital: 2 objectives (13.3% of total)
- Customer: 3 objectives (20.0% of total)
- Innovation: 2 objectives (13.3% of total)
- ESG: 1 objective (6.7% of total)

Total Objectives: 15
Distribution Series: [4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Percentage Distribution Analysis

**Percentage Calculation:**
```
Category Percentage = (Category Objectives ÷ Total Objectives) × 100

Example:
Growth Percentage = (4 ÷ 15) × 100 = 26.7%
Operations Percentage = (3 ÷ 15) × 100 = 20.0%
HR Percentage = (2 ÷ 15) × 100 = 13.3%
Customer Percentage = (3 ÷ 15) × 100 = 20.0%
Innovation Percentage = (2 ÷ 15) × 100 = 13.3%
ESG Percentage = (1 ÷ 15) × 100 = 6.7%

Total: 100.0%
```

### Strategic Balance Assessment

**Balance Analysis Formula:**
```
Strategic Balance Assessment:
- Ideal Range per Category: 10-30% of total objectives
- Minimum Threshold: At least 1 objective per category
- Maximum Threshold: No more than 40% in single category

Balance Status:
if (Category % < 10%) → "Under-represented"
if (Category % > 30%) → "Over-concentrated"  
if (10% ≤ Category % ≤ 30%) → "Well-balanced"
```

**Balance Assessment Example:**
```
TechCorp Balance Analysis:
- Growth: 26.7% → Well-balanced ✓
- Operations: 20.0% → Well-balanced ✓
- HR: 13.3% → Well-balanced ✓
- Customer: 20.0% → Well-balanced ✓
- Innovation: 13.3% → Well-balanced ✓
- ESG: 6.7% → Under-represented ⚠️

Assessment: Generally well-balanced portfolio with ESG area needing additional focus
```
