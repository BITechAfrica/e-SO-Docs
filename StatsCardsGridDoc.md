# Strategic Performance Cards Grid - Key Performance Indicators Dashboard

## Description and Overview

The Strategic Performance Cards Grid is the central dashboard component that provides an immediate, at-a-glance view of your organization's strategic performance across four critical areas. This grid displays four distinct performance cards, each representing a key pillar of strategic execution:

1. **Strategic Projects Card** - Shows total number of projects and active strategic initiatives
2. **Strategic Objectives Card** - Displays total objectives and those successfully achieved
3. **Sub-Objectives Card** - Presents sub-objective totals and completion status
4. **Overall Performance Card** - Provides a comprehensive performance percentage with status indicator

Each card features:
- A distinctive icon representing the metric category
- The primary metric displayed as a large, prominent number
- A descriptive label explaining what the metric represents
- Additional contextual information showing breakdowns or status details

The cards are arranged in a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Why is it Important

The Strategic Performance Cards Grid serves as the **executive dashboard** for strategic decision-making, providing several critical business benefits:

### **Immediate Performance Visibility**
- Enables executives and managers to quickly assess organizational performance without diving into detailed reports
- Provides real-time insight into strategic progress across all key areas
- Supports rapid identification of areas requiring attention or intervention

### **Strategic Alignment Monitoring**
- Ensures all strategic initiatives are tracked and measured consistently
- Provides transparency into how well the organization is executing its strategic plan
- Facilitates data-driven discussions during executive meetings and board presentations

### **Performance Accountability**
- Creates clear metrics that teams and departments can rally around
- Establishes benchmarks for success across different strategic dimensions
- Enables tracking of progress over time to identify trends and patterns

### **Resource Allocation Guidance**
- Helps leadership understand where resources are being effectively utilized
- Identifies underperforming areas that may need additional support or restructuring
- Supports budgeting and planning decisions based on current performance data

## Calculation Formulas and Methodology

### **Strategic Projects Card**

**Total Projects Calculation:**
```
Total Projects = Count of all projects in the system
Formula: totalProjects = projects.length
```

**Active Projects Calculation:**
```
Active Projects = Count of projects classified as "Strategic"
Formula: activeProjects = projects.filter(project => 
    project.schedule.projectClassification === "Strategic").length
```

**Example:**
- If you have 15 projects total, and 8 are classified as "Strategic"
- Strategic Projects Card shows: **15** (Total Projects)
- Detail line shows: **8 Active** (Strategic Projects)

### **Strategic Objectives Card**

**Total Objectives Calculation:**
```
Total Objectives = Count of all strategic objectives across all categories
Formula: totalObjectives = strategicObjectives.length
```

**Achieved Objectives Calculation:**
```
Achieved Objectives = Count of objectives where actual performance meets or exceeds target
Formula: achievedObjectives = strategicObjectives.filter(objective => 
    parseFloat(objective.actualMeasure) >= parseFloat(objective.targetMeasure)).length
```

**Example:**
- If you have 24 strategic objectives total
- 18 objectives have achieved their target performance
- Strategic Objectives Card shows: **24** (Total Objectives)
- Detail line shows: **18 Achieved** (Met or exceeded targets)

### **Sub-Objectives Card**

**Total Sub-Objectives Calculation:**
```
Total Sub-Objectives = Sum of all sub-objectives across all strategic categories
Formula: totalSubObjectives = strategicObjectives.reduce((total, objective) => 
    total + (objective.subObjectives ? objective.subObjectives.length : 0), 0)
```

**Completed Sub-Objectives Calculation:**
```
Completed Sub-Objectives = Count of sub-objectives that have been implemented
Formula: completedSubObjectives = strategicObjectives.reduce((total, objective) => {
    categorySubObjectives = getAvailableSubObjectivesForCategory(objective.objectiveName)
    completedCount = categorySubObjectives.filter(subObjDef =>
        objective.subObjectives.some(sub => sub.name === subObjDef.name)).length
    return total + completedCount
}, 0)
```

**Example:**
- If you have 72 possible sub-objectives across all categories
- 45 sub-objectives have been completed/implemented
- Sub-Objectives Card shows: **72** (Total Sub-Objectives)
- Detail line shows: **45 Completed** (Implemented sub-objectives)

### **Overall Performance Card**

**Overall Performance Percentage Calculation:**
```
Overall Performance = Average performance percentage across all strategic objectives
Formula: overallPerformance = Math.round(
    strategicObjectives.reduce((sum, objective) => {
        actual = parseFloat(objective.actualMeasure || 0)
        target = parseFloat(objective.targetMeasure || 1)
        performance = Math.min((actual / target) * 100, 100)
        return sum + performance
    }, 0) / strategicObjectives.length
)
```

**Performance Status Determination:**
```
Performance Status Rules:
- 90% or higher = "Excellent"
- 75% to 89% = "Good"  
- 60% to 74% = "Fair"
- Below 60% = "Needs Improvement"
```

**Example:**
- Objective 1: Actual 95, Target 100 = 95% performance
- Objective 2: Actual 80, Target 90 = 88.9% performance  
- Objective 3: Actual 110, Target 100 = 100% performance (capped at 100%)
- Average: (95 + 88.9 + 100) ÷ 3 = 94.6%
- Overall Performance Card shows: **95%** (rounded)
- Performance Status shows: **Excellent** (≥90%)
