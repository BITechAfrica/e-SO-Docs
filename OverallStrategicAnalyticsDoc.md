## 🧮 Calculations & Metrics Explained

### 📊 Core Performance Metrics

#### **Overall Performance**
```javascript
overallPerformance = Σ(min(actualMeasure/targetMeasure × 100, 100)) ÷ totalObjectives
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Provides a unified view of organizational performance against strategic targets. The 100% cap prevents any single high-performing objective from masking underperformance elsewhere.

**📈 Example**: If you have 6 objectives with performances of 120%, 85%, 90%, 75%, 65%, and 40%, the calculation becomes:
```
(100 + 85 + 90 + 75 + 65 + 40) ÷ 6 = 75.8%
```

#### **Target Achievement Rate**
```javascript
achievementRate = (objectivesMetOrExceededTarget ÷ totalObjectives) × 100
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Shows execution effectiveness - what percentage of your strategic objectives are actually succeeding.

### 🎯 Strategic Category Analysis

#### **Performance by Category**
```javascript
categoryPerformance = Σ(objectivePerformanceInCategory) ÷ objectivesInCategory
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Identifies which strategic pillars (Growth, Innovation, ESG, etc.) are excelling and which need resource reallocation.

**📊 Strategic Categories**:
- **Growth**: Revenue, market share, headcount expansion
- **Customer Centric**: Satisfaction, NPS, retention
- **Operation Excellence**: Productivity, efficiency, availability
- **Innovation**: R&D investment, new product revenue
- **ESG**: Sustainable products, environmental impact
- **Human Capital**: Engagement, retention, satisfaction

#### **Sub-Objectives Completion Rate**
```javascript
completionRate = (completedSubObjectives ÷ totalPossibleSubObjectives) × 100
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Sub-objectives are the tactical building blocks of strategic success. This ensures comprehensive execution at the granular level.

### 🚨 Risk Assessment Calculations

#### **Risk Level Determination**
```javascript
if (performance < 60% || criticalAreas > 2) return "High Risk"
else if (performance < 75% || criticalAreas > 0) return "Medium Risk"  
else return "Low Risk"
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Provides early warning systems for strategic initiatives falling behind, enabling proactive intervention before issues become critical.

#### **Critical Areas Identification**
```javascript
criticalAreas = categories.filter(category => category.performance < 60%)
```
**💡 Why we need it**: Pinpoints specific strategic areas requiring immediate attention and resource reallocation.
