## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Category Performance Calculation

**Primary Formula:**
```
Category Average Performance = Σ(Individual Objective Performance) ÷ Number of Objectives in Category

Where:
Individual Objective Performance = (Actual Measure ÷ Target Measure) × 100
(Capped at 100% maximum)
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Group Objectives by Category**:
   - Collect all objectives belonging to each strategic category
   - Categories: Growth, Operations Excellence, Human Capital, Customer Centric, Innovation, ESG

2. **Calculate Individual Objective Performance**:
   ```
   For each objective in the category:
   Performance Score = (Actual Achievement ÷ Target Value) × 100
   If Performance Score > 100%, then cap at 100%
   ```

3. **Calculate Category Average**:
   ```
   Category Performance = Sum of all objective performances ÷ Number of objectives
   Round to nearest whole number
   ```

4. **Rank Categories**:
   - Sort all categories by their average performance (highest to lowest)
   - Display top 3 performing categories

### Detailed Calculation Example

**Strategic Category: Growth**
```
Growth Objectives:
1. Revenue Growth: Target $50M, Actual $58M
   Performance = (58 ÷ 50) × 100 = 116% → Capped at 100%

2. Market Share: Target 25%, Actual 23%
   Performance = (23 ÷ 25) × 100 = 92%

3. Head Count Growth: Target 100 employees, Actual 105
   Performance = (105 ÷ 100) × 100 = 105% → Capped at 100%

Growth Category Performance = (100% + 92% + 100%) ÷ 3 = 97%
```

**Strategic Category: Operations Excellence**
```
Operations Objectives:
1. Productivity Improvement: Target 15%, Actual 12%
   Performance = (12 ÷ 15) × 100 = 80%

2. Efficiency: Target 90%, Actual 88%
   Performance = (88 ÷ 90) × 100 = 98%

3. System Availability: Target 99%, Actual 99.5%
   Performance = (99.5 ÷ 99) × 100 = 100%

Operations Category Performance = (80% + 98% + 100%) ÷ 3 = 93%
```

**Strategic Category: Human Capital**
```
HR Objectives:
1. Employee Engagement: Target 85%, Actual 82%
   Performance = (82 ÷ 85) × 100 = 96%

2. Retention Rate: Target 90%, Actual 87%
   Performance = (87 ÷ 90) × 100 = 97%

3. Job Satisfaction: Target 4.0, Actual 3.8
   Performance = (3.8 ÷ 4.0) × 100 = 95%

HR Category Performance = (96% + 97% + 95%) ÷ 3 = 96%
```

### Ranking Logic
```
Final Rankings (Highest to Lowest):
1. Growth: 97% (Excellent status)
2. Human Capital: 96% (Excellent status)  
3. Operations Excellence: 93% (Excellent status)

Top 3 categories displayed in widget with performance scores and status badges.
```

### Status Classification

**Performance Thresholds:**
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: Green badge, star icon
- **Good (75-89%)**: Blue badge, thumbs-up icon
- **Fair (60-74%)**: Orange badge, warning icon
- **Poor (0-59%)**: Red badge, alert icon

   - Revenue Growth: 92% of target
   - Market Share: 85% of target  
   - Head Count: 90% of target
