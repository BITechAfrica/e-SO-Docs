## Description and Overview

The **Risk Assessment Widget** serves as an early warning system for strategic execution, providing executives with immediate visibility into potential performance risks across all strategic initiatives. This widget analyzes current performance data to identify areas requiring immediate attention, moderate intervention, or ongoing monitoring.

The widget displays:
- **Risk Level Indicator** - Overall risk status with color-coded alert level
- **Critical Areas Count** - Number of strategic categories performing below acceptable thresholds
- **Behind Target Objectives** - Count of objectives not meeting performance expectations
- **Pending Tasks** - Number of incomplete sub-objectives requiring attention
- **Risk Status Messages** - Contextual alerts based on current performance data

This widget enables proactive risk management by highlighting potential issues before they become critical business problems.

## Why is it Important

### Strategic Risk Management
The Risk Assessment Widget is vital for organizational health because it:

1. **Early Warning System**: Identifies performance risks before they escalate into critical issues
2. **Proactive Management**: Enables intervention while problems are still manageable
3. **Resource Allocation**: Helps prioritize where additional support is most needed
4. **Crisis Prevention**: Prevents small issues from becoming organizational crises
5. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrates systematic approach to risk monitoring

### Executive Benefits
- **Risk Visibility**: Clear understanding of current organizational risk exposure
- **Priority Setting**: Data-driven identification of what needs immediate attention
- **Decision Support**: Quantified risk information for strategic decision-making
- **Performance Protection**: Safeguards against strategic initiative failures

## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Overall Risk Level Calculation

**Primary Risk Assessment Formula:**
```
Risk Level = f(Overall Performance, Critical Areas Count, Underperforming Objectives)

Where:
- Overall Performance = Average performance across all strategic objectives
- Critical Areas = Strategic categories with poor performance (< 60%)
- Underperforming Objectives = Objectives with < 75% target achievement
```

**Risk Level Determination Logic:**
```
if (Overall Performance < 60% OR Critical Areas > 2) {
    Risk Level = "High Risk"
} else if (Overall Performance < 75% OR Critical Areas > 0) {
    Risk Level = "Medium Risk"  
} else {
    Risk Level = "Low Risk"
}
```

### Critical Areas (Poor Performing Categories) Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Critical Areas = Count of strategic categories with performance < 60%

Poor Performing Category = Category where:
Average Performance < 60% AND Completion Rate < 40%
```

**Detailed Process:**
1. **Calculate Category Performance**:
   ```
   For each strategic category:
   Category Performance = Σ(Objective Performance) ÷ Number of Objectives
   ```

2. **Assess Category Status**:
   ```
   if (Category Performance < 60% AND Completion Rate < 40%) {
       Category Status = "Critical" (Poor Performing)
   } else if (Category Performance < 75% AND Completion Rate < 60%) {
       Category Status = "Warning" (Underperforming)
   } else {
       Category Status = "Healthy"
   }
   ```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Strategic Category Assessment:
1. Growth: 45% performance, 35% completion → Critical ⚠️
2. Operations: 72% performance, 65% completion → Warning ⚡
3. HR: 88% performance, 80% completion → Healthy ✅
4. Customer: 55% performance, 30% completion → Critical ⚠️
5. Innovation: 90% performance, 85% completion → Healthy ✅
6. ESG: 65% performance, 50% completion → Warning ⚡

Critical Areas Count = 2 (Growth, Customer)
```

### Underperforming Objectives Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Underperforming Objectives = Count of objectives with performance < 75%

Where:
Objective Performance = (Actual Measure ÷ Target Measure) × 100
```

**Calculation Process:**
1. **Evaluate Each Objective**:
   ```
   For each strategic objective:
   Performance Ratio = Actual Achievement ÷ Target Value
   Performance Percentage = Performance Ratio × 100
   
   if (Performance Percentage < 75%) {
       Count as "Underperforming"
   }
   ```

2. **Sum Underperforming Objectives**:
   - Count all objectives below 75% threshold
   - This represents objectives requiring intervention

**Example:**
```
Objective Performance Analysis:
1. Revenue Growth: 92% of target → Performing well ✅
2. Market Share: 68% of target → Underperforming ⚠️
3. Employee Engagement: 82% of target → Performing well ✅
4. Customer Satisfaction: 65% of target → Underperforming ⚠️
5. Innovation Pipeline: 55% of target → Underperforming ⚠️
6. ESG Score: 78% of target → Performing well ✅

Underperforming Objectives = 3 (Market Share, Customer Satisfaction, Innovation Pipeline)
```

### Incomplete Sub-Objectives Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Incomplete Sub-Objectives = Total Available Sub-Objectives - Completed Sub-Objectives

Where:
Total Available = Σ(Predefined Sub-Objectives × Objectives per Category)
Completed = Count of implemented sub-objectives matching standards
```

**Detailed Calculation:**
1. **Calculate Total Possible Sub-Objectives**:
   ```
   For each strategic category:
   Available Sub-Objectives = Number of Objectives × 3 (standard sub-objectives per category)
   
   Total Available = Growth Available + Operations Available + HR Available + ...
   ```

2. **Count Completed Sub-Objectives**:
   - Match actual sub-objectives against predefined standards
   - Count only complete matches

3. **Calculate Pending**:
   ```
   Incomplete Sub-Objectives = Total Available - Completed
   ```

**Real-World Example:**

**TechCorp Q3 2024 Risk Assessment:**
```
Overall Performance Calculation:
- 15 strategic objectives across all categories
- Average performance: 68% (below 75% threshold)
- Status: Medium-High Risk

Critical Areas Assessment:
- Growth Category: 52% performance → Critical
- Customer Category: 48% performance → Critical  
- Operations Category: 76% performance → Healthy
- HR Category: 85% performance → Healthy
Critical Areas Count: 2

Underperforming Objectives:
- Growth objectives: 2 out of 4 below 75%
- Customer objectives: 3 out of 3 below 75%
- Operations objectives: 1 out of 3 below 75%
- HR objectives: 0 out of 2 below 75%
Total Underperforming: 6 objectives

Incomplete Sub-Objectives:
- Total possible: 15 objectives × 3 = 45 sub-objectives
- Completed: 28 sub-objectives
- Incomplete: 45 - 28 = 17 pending tasks

Risk Level Determination:
- Overall Performance: 68% < 75% → Risk Factor
- Critical Areas: 2 > 0 → Risk Factor
- Result: "Medium Risk" with trending toward High Risk
```

### Risk Status Messages

**Risk Alert Logic:**
```
High Risk Items (Critical Priority):
- if (poorPerformingCategories.length > 0) → "X Critical Areas need immediate attention"

Medium Risk Items (Moderate Priority):  
- if (underperformingObjectives > 0) → "X objectives behind target"

Low Risk Items (Monitoring Priority):
- if (incompleteSubObjectives > 0) → "X pending tasks"

Success Items (All Clear):
- if (riskLevel === "Low Risk") → "All Systems Green"
```
