## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Insight Generation Algorithm

**Primary Insight Formula:**
```
Strategic Insights = f(Performance Patterns, Risk Levels, Achievement Rates, Trend Analysis)

Where:
- Performance Patterns = Analysis of category and objective performance
- Risk Levels = Assessment of underperforming areas
- Achievement Rates = Success and failure pattern analysis
- Trend Analysis = Historical performance trajectory evaluation
```

### Performance-Based Insights

**Performance Threshold Analysis:**
```
if (Overall Performance < 60%) {
    Generate: "Performance Below Target" insight
    Type: WARNING
    Priority: HIGH
} else if (Overall Performance ≥ 90%) {
    Generate: "Excellent Performance" insight  
    Type: SUCCESS
    Priority: RECOGNITION
}
```

**Detailed Performance Insight Calculation:**
```
Performance Analysis:
1. Calculate overall performance percentage
2. Compare against performance thresholds
3. Generate appropriate insight type and message
4. Provide specific action recommendations
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Current Performance Analysis:
Overall Performance = 58%
Threshold Check: 58% < 60% → Below Target
Generated Insight:
- Type: "warning"
- Icon: "fa fa-exclamation-triangle"  
- Title: "Performance Below Target"
- Description: "Overall performance is at 58%, which is below the recommended 75% threshold."
- Action: "Focus on underperforming objectives and consider resource reallocation."
```

### Sub-Objectives Analysis Insights

**Sub-Objectives Completion Analysis:**
```
Sub-Objectives Completion Rate = (Completed Sub-Objectives ÷ Total Sub-Objectives) × 100

if (Completion Rate < 50%) {
    Generate: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention" insight
    Type: INFO
    Focus: Tactical execution improvement
}
```

**Calculation Process:**
1. **Assess Completion Rate**:
   ```
   Total Possible Sub-Objectives = Σ(Category Objectives × 3 standard sub-objectives)
   Completed Sub-Objectives = Count of implemented sub-objectives
   Completion Rate = (Completed ÷ Total Possible) × 100
   ```

2. **Generate Insight**:
   ```
   if (Completion Rate < 50%) {
       Insight = {
           type: "info",
           title: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention",
           description: "Only X% of sub-objectives are completed across all strategic areas.",
           action: "Prioritize completing sub-objectives to ensure comprehensive strategy execution."
       }
   }
   ```

**Example:**
```
Sub-Objectives Analysis:
Total Possible: 36 sub-objectives (12 objectives × 3 each)
Completed: 16 sub-objectives
Completion Rate = (16 ÷ 36) × 100 = 44%

Generated Insight:
- Type: "info"
- Title: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention"
- Description: "Only 44% of sub-objectives are completed across all strategic areas."
- Action: "Prioritize completing sub-objectives to ensure comprehensive strategy execution."
```

### Category-Specific Insights

**Poor Performing Categories Analysis:**
```
Poor Categories = Categories with performance < 60% AND completion < 40%

if (Poor Categories Count > 0) {
    Generate: "Critical Areas Identified" insight
    Type: DANGER
    Impact: HIGH
}
```

**Category Performance Insight Generation:**
```
For each strategic category:
1. Calculate average performance
2. Calculate completion rate
3. Determine status classification
4. Generate insights for poor performers
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Category Performance Analysis:
- Growth: 45% performance, 30% completion → Poor
- Customer: 52% performance, 35% completion → Poor  
- Operations: 78% performance, 70% completion → Good
- HR: 85% performance, 80% completion → Excellent

Poor Categories: [Growth, Customer]
Generated Insight:
- Type: "danger"
- Title: "Critical Areas Identified"  
- Description: "Growth, Customer require immediate attention."
- Action: "Develop action plans for these strategic areas to improve performance."
```

### Success Recognition Insights

**Excellence Identification:**
```
Excellent Categories = Categories with performance ≥ 90% AND completion ≥ 80%

if (Excellent Categories Count > 0) {
    Generate: "Leading Categories" insight
    Type: SUCCESS
    Focus: Best practice sharing
}
```

**Success Insight Calculation:**
```
Excellence Analysis:
1. Identify top-performing categories
2. Calculate achievement metrics
3. Generate recognition insight
4. Recommend best practice scaling
```

**Example:**
```
Excellence Analysis:
- Innovation: 94% performance, 85% completion → Excellent
- HR: 91% performance, 82% completion → Excellent
- Operations: 78% performance, 70% completion → Good (not excellent)

Excellent Categories: [Innovation, HR]
Generated Insight:
- Type: "success"
- Title: "Leading Categories"
- Description: "Innovation, HR are performing exceptionally well."
- Action: "Leverage successful strategies from these areas for other categories."
```

### Real-World Insight Generation Example

**TechCorp Q3 2024 Strategic Insights:**

**Performance Data Analysis:**
```
Overall Performance: 68%
Sub-Objectives Completion: 42%
Poor Categories: Growth (45%), Customer (52%)
Excellent Categories: Innovation (94%)
Underperforming Objectives: 6 out of 12
```

**Generated Insights:**
```
1. PERFORMANCE INSIGHT:
   Type: "info" (68% is between 60-75%, so not warning level)
   Title: "Performance Tracking Well"
   Description: "Overall performance at 68% shows steady progress toward targets."
   Action: "Focus on bringing underperforming areas up to organization average."

2. SUB-OBJECTIVES INSIGHT:
   Type: "info"
   Title: "Sub-Objectives Need Attention"
   Description: "Only 42% of sub-objectives are completed across all strategic areas."
   Action: "Prioritize completing sub-objectives to ensure comprehensive strategy execution."

3. CRITICAL AREAS INSIGHT:
   Type: "danger"
   Title: "Critical Areas Identified"
   Description: "Growth, Customer require immediate attention."
   Action: "Develop action plans for these strategic areas to improve performance."

4. SUCCESS INSIGHT:
   Type: "success"
   Title: "Leading Categories"
   Description: "Innovation is performing exceptionally well."
   Action: "Leverage successful strategies from Innovation for other categories."
```

### Insight Prioritization Logic

**Priority Ranking System:**
```
1. DANGER insights (Critical performance issues) → Highest Priority
2. WARNING insights (Performance below target) → High Priority  
3. INFO insights (Tactical improvements needed) → Medium Priority
4. SUCCESS insights (Recognition and scaling) → Low Priority
```

**Display Algorithm:**
```
Maximum Insights Displayed = 4
Selection Criteria:
1. Include all DANGER and WARNING insights
2. Include most relevant INFO insights
3. Include at least one SUCCESS insight for balance
4. Ensure variety of insight types for comprehensive view
```
