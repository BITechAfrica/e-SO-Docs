## Description and Overview

The **Quick Metrics Widget** provides a rapid-fire view of four essential performance indicators that executives need to monitor regularly. This widget condenses critical organizational metrics into an easily digestible format, enabling leaders to perform quick health checks and spot-check performance across key strategic dimensions.

The widget displays:
- **Target Achievement Rate** - Percentage of objectives meeting or exceeding targets
- **Average Progress** - Mean progress across all strategic initiatives  
- **Resource Utilization** - Efficiency of resource deployment across projects
- **Growth Rate** - Positive trajectory indicator for organizational development

This widget serves as a "dashboard of dashboards," providing the most critical metrics that executives need for rapid decision-making and situational awareness.

- **Performance Culture**: Reinforces data-driven decision making across leadership

## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Target Achievement Rate

**Formula:**
```
Target Achievement Rate = (Number of Achieved Objectives ÷ Total Objectives) × 100

Where:
Achieved Objective = Objective where Actual Measure ≥ Target Measure
```

**Detailed Calculation:**
1. **Evaluate Each Objective**:
   ```
   For each strategic objective:
   if (Actual Measure ≥ Target Measure) {
       Count as "Achieved"
   } else {
       Count as "Not Achieved"  
   }
   ```

2. **Calculate Achievement Rate**:
   ```
   Achievement Rate = (Achieved Count ÷ Total Count) × 100
   Round to nearest whole number
   ```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Strategic Objectives Evaluation:
1. Revenue Growth: Target $50M, Actual $52M → Achieved ✓
2. Market Share: Target 25%, Actual 23% → Not Achieved ✗
3. Employee Engagement: Target 85%, Actual 87% → Achieved ✓
4. Customer Satisfaction: Target 90%, Actual 88% → Not Achieved ✗
5. Innovation Projects: Target 10, Actual 12 → Achieved ✓
6. ESG Score: Target 75, Actual 73 → Not Achieved ✗

Achieved Objectives: 3 (Revenue, Engagement, Innovation)
Total Objectives: 6
Target Achievement Rate = (3 ÷ 6) × 100 = 50%
```

### Average Progress

**Formula:**
```
Average Progress = Σ(Individual Objective Progress) ÷ Number of Objectives

Where:
Individual Objective Progress = (Actual Measure ÷ Target Measure) × 100
(Capped at 100% maximum per objective)
```

**Calculation Process:**
1. **Calculate Each Objective's Progress**:
   ```
   For each objective:
   Progress = (Actual ÷ Target) × 100
   if (Progress > 100%) then Progress = 100%
   ```

2. **Calculate Overall Average**:
   ```
   Average Progress = Sum of all progress values ÷ Number of objectives
   Round to nearest whole number
   ```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Individual Objective Progress:
1. Revenue Growth: (52 ÷ 50) × 100 = 104% → Capped at 100%
2. Market Share: (23 ÷ 25) × 100 = 92%
3. Employee Engagement: (87 ÷ 85) × 100 = 102% → Capped at 100%
4. Customer Satisfaction: (88 ÷ 90) × 100 = 98%
5. Innovation Projects: (12 ÷ 10) × 100 = 120% → Capped at 100%
6. ESG Score: (73 ÷ 75) × 100 = 97%

Progress Values: [100%, 92%, 100%, 98%, 100%, 97%]
Sum: 100 + 92 + 100 + 98 + 100 + 97 = 587%
Average Progress = 587 ÷ 6 = 98%
```

### Resource Utilization

**Formula:**
```
Resource Utilization = (Completed Sub-Objectives ÷ Total Available Sub-Objectives) × 100

Where:
Total Available = Strategic capacity across all categories
Completed = Actual implementation and delivery
```

**Calculation Logic:**
1. **Determine Total Capacity**:
   ```
   Total Available Sub-Objectives = Σ(Objectives per Category × Standard Sub-Objectives)
   
   Standard Sub-Objectives per Category = 3
   Total Capacity = (Growth Objectives × 3) + (Operations Objectives × 3) + ...
   ```

2. **Count Completed Work**:
   ```
   Completed Sub-Objectives = Count of implemented sub-objectives matching standards
   ```

3. **Calculate Utilization Rate**:
   ```
   Resource Utilization = (Completed ÷ Total Available) × 100
   ```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Organizational Capacity:
- Growth: 4 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 12 capacity
- Operations: 3 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 9 capacity  
- HR: 2 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 6 capacity
- Customer: 3 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 9 capacity
Total Capacity = 12 + 9 + 6 + 9 = 36 sub-objectives

Completed Work:
- Growth: 8 completed sub-objectives
- Operations: 7 completed sub-objectives
- HR: 5 completed sub-objectives  
- Customer: 6 completed sub-objectives
Total Completed = 8 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 26 sub-objectives

Resource Utilization = (26 ÷ 36) × 100 = 72%
```

### Growth Rate

**Formula:**
```
Growth Rate = Overall Performance × Growth Factor

Where:
Growth Factor = Performance improvement multiplier (typically 0.3)
This represents positive momentum and trajectory
```

**Calculation Method:**
1. **Base Performance**:
   ```
   Base Performance = Current overall performance percentage
   ```

2. **Apply Growth Factor**:
   ```
   Growth Rate = Base Performance × 0.3
   Round to nearest whole number
   Add "+" prefix to indicate positive growth
   ```

**Alternative Calculation (with historical data):**
```
If historical data available:
Growth Rate = ((Current Performance - Previous Performance) ÷ Previous Performance) × 100

Example:
Previous Quarter: 78% performance
Current Quarter: 85% performance
Growth Rate = ((85 - 78) ÷ 78) × 100 = 9%
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Current Scenario:
Overall Performance: 85%
Growth Factor: 0.3

Growth Rate = 85% × 0.3 = 25.5% → Rounded to 26%
Display: "+26%" (indicating positive growth trajectory)

Business Interpretation:
- Organization showing strong positive momentum
- Performance trending upward across strategic areas
- Growth rate indicates healthy organizational development
```

### Real-World Comprehensive Example

**TechCorp Q3 2024 Quick Metrics:**

**Target Achievement Rate Calculation:**
```
Objective Assessment:
- Revenue: $58M actual vs $50M target → Achieved ✓
- Market Share: 23% vs 25% target → Not Achieved ✗
- Engagement: 87% vs 85% target → Achieved ✓
- Retention: 88% vs 90% target → Not Achieved ✗
- Innovation: 12 vs 10 target → Achieved ✓
- ESG: 73 vs 75 target → Not Achieved ✗

Achievement Rate = (3 achieved ÷ 6 total) × 100 = 50%
```

**Average Progress Calculation:**
```
Individual Progress:
- Revenue: (58÷50)×100 = 116% → 100% (capped)
- Market Share: (23÷25)×100 = 92%
- Engagement: (87÷85)×100 = 102% → 100% (capped)
- Retention: (88÷90)×100 = 98%
- Innovation: (12÷10)×100 = 120% → 100% (capped)
- ESG: (73÷75)×100 = 97%

Average = (100+92+100+98+100+97) ÷ 6 = 98%
```

**Resource Utilization Calculation:**
```
Capacity Analysis:
- 6 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 18 total capacity
- 13 completed sub-objectives
- Utilization = (13÷18)×100 = 72%
```

**Growth Rate Calculation:**
```
Current Performance: 98%
Growth Rate = 98% × 0.3 = 29%
Display: "+29%"
```
