# Performance Overview Widget

## Description and Overview

The **Performance Overview Widget** is the central command center of the Strategic Analytics Dashboard. This widget provides executives and project managers with an immediate visual summary of organizational performance across all strategic initiatives. It combines a radial chart visualization with key performance metrics to deliver a comprehensive snapshot of strategic execution health.

The widget displays:
- **Overall Performance Percentage** - A large, prominent percentage showing aggregate performance
- **Objectives on Track** - Ratio of achieved objectives to total objectives
- **Sub-Objectives Progress** - Completion percentage of detailed action items
- **Visual Radial Chart** - Color-coded circular progress indicator

This widget serves as the first point of reference for leadership teams to quickly assess whether the organization is meeting its strategic goals.

## Why is it Important

### Business Impact
The Performance Overview Widget is crucial for strategic management because it:

1. **Executive Decision Making**: Provides leadership with instant visibility into organizational health
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Enables real-time tracking of strategic execution across all initiatives
3. **Risk Identification**: Quickly highlights when performance drops below acceptable thresholds
4. **Resource Allocation**: Helps determine where additional resources or attention should be focused
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Offers clear, quantifiable metrics for board presentations and investor updates

### Strategic Value

- **Proactive Management**: Enables early intervention before performance issues become critical

## Calculation Methods and Formulas

### Overall Performance Percentage

**Formula:**
```
Overall Performance = Average of All Objective Performance Scores

Where:
Individual Objective Performance = (Actual Measure ÷ Target Measure) × 100
(Capped at maximum of 100%)

Overall Performance = Σ(Individual Objective Performance) ÷ Total Number of Objectives
```

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Calculate Each Objective's Performance**:
   - Take the actual achievement value for each objective
   - Divide by the target value for that objective
   - Multiply by 100 to get percentage
   - Cap the result at 100% (no over-performance credit)

2. **Calculate Overall Average**:
   - Sum all individual objective performances
   - Divide by the total number of objectives
   - Round to nearest whole number

**Example Calculation:**
```
Objective 1: Revenue Growth
- Target: $50M, Actual: $60M
- Performance = (60 ÷ 50) × 100 = 120% → Capped at 100%

Objective 2: Market Share
- Target: 25%, Actual: 22%
- Performance = (22 ÷ 25) × 100 = 88%

Objective 3: Employee Satisfaction
- Target: 85%, Actual: 90%
- Performance = (90 ÷ 85) × 100 = 105.9% → Capped at 100%

Overall Performance = (100% + 88% + 100%) ÷ 3 = 96%
```

### Objectives on Track

**Formula:**
```
Objectives on Track = Number of Achieved Objectives ÷ Total Objectives

Where:
Achieved Objective = Actual Measure ≥ Target Measure
```

**Calculation Process:**
1. Count all objectives where actual performance meets or exceeds target
2. Divide by total number of objectives
3. Display as ratio (e.g., "8/12" means 8 achieved out of 12 total)

**Example:**
```
Total Objectives: 12
- Growth objectives: 3 (2 achieved, 1 behind)
- Operations objectives: 4 (3 achieved, 1 behind)
- HR objectives: 3 (3 achieved, 0 behind)
- Customer objectives: 2 (1 achieved, 1 behind)

Total Achieved = 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 9
Display: "9/12" (75% achievement rate)
```

### Sub-Objectives Progress

**Formula:**
```
Sub-Objectives Progress = (Completed Sub-Objectives ÷ Total Available Sub-Objectives) × 100

Where:
Total Available = Σ(Predefined Sub-Objectives per Category × Objectives in that Category)
Completed = Count of implemented sub-objectives matching predefined list
```

**Detailed Calculation:**
1. **Determine Available Sub-Objectives per Category**:
   - Growth: 3 predefined sub-objectives (Revenue growth, Market share, Head Count)
   - Operations: 3 predefined sub-objectives (Productivity, Efficiency, Availability)
   - Human Capital: 3 predefined sub-objectives (Engagement, Retention, Job satisfaction)
   - Each category has 3 standard sub-objectives

2. **Calculate Total Possible**:
   ```
   Total Possible = (Number of Growth Objectives × 3) + 
                   (Number of Operations Objectives × 3) + 
                   (Number of HR Objectives × 3) + ...
   ```

3. **Count Completed Sub-Objectives**:
   - Match actual sub-objectives against predefined list
   - Count only those that appear in both lists

**Example Calculation:**
```
Strategic Categories with Objectives:
- Growth: 4 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 12 possible
- Operations: 3 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 9 possible  
- HR: 2 objectives × 3 sub-objectives = 6 possible
Total Possible = 12 + 9 + 6 = 27 sub-objectives

Completed Sub-Objectives:
- Growth: 8 completed (67% of category)
- Operations: 7 completed (78% of category)
- HR: 5 completed (83% of category)
Total Completed = 8 + 7 + 5 = 20 sub-objectives

Progress = (20 ÷ 27) × 100 = 74%
```

## Color Coding and Status Indicators
